\section{Brief Description}
 
\subsection{Profile}
Manipulator is a kind of mechanical and electronic equipment that simulates the function of human arm and wrist. It can move any object according to the requirements. It can not only move in a simple direction, but also complete a certain combination action. According to people's different needs, different combinations of moving direction and distance can be designed to meet the needs of users.

Intelligent manufacturing with industrial manipulator as the core is an important means to promote the transformation and upgrading of China's manufacturing industry. In the future, with the continuous expansion of industrial manipulator applications and the transformation of intelligent manufacturing, China's industrial manipulator has great development potential. Therefore, independent development and design of an industrial manipulator is necessary and has broad prospects.

The general manipulator is divided into software part and hardware part. As the overall control part of the whole system, the software part is mainly responsible for the user interaction part, receiving user input and controlling the hardware part to respond.

This project is a writing education manipulator, through the use of a combination of software and hardware, as well as the application of raspberry pie, to complete the basic mobile, path planning and writing operations.

\subsection{Architecture Design}
\subsubsection{Hardware Design}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/HA}
	\caption{Hardware Architecture Diagram}
	\label{fig:HA}
\end{figure}
The hardware structure of the system is shown in the figure1. The system consists of four layers: power supply layer, control layer, upper computer layer and execution layer.

The power supply layer selects the knob power supply as the power supply equipment for the whole system, which supplies the three motors on the manipulator and also supplies power to the raspberry pie.

The upper computer layer is composed of raspberry pie. In this system, the upper computer can send the end target of the end effector of the manipulator. Through the kinematics calculation of the upper computer, the related operations of the three motors are obtained. This information is used as the control information and transmitted to the lower computer through the serial port, that is, the control layer. At the same time, raspberry pie can be connected to the display screen to design gui interface for intuitive operation visualization.

The control layer is composed of motion control board stm32f103zbt6, which connects three motors. The control layer receives the relevant control information (including motor number and rotation angle) sent by the upper computer layer through the serial port, and outputs the pulse signal to control the motor movement. At the same time, the control layer can also send feedback information to the upper computer layer to explain the control effect.

The execution layer is composed of a mechanical arm and a paint barrel. The executive layer receives the voltage signal from the control layer to enable the motor. Under the linkage movement of the three motors, it realizes the control of the paint barrel operated by the end actuator, and realizes the target requirements of the upper computer.

\subsubsection{Software Design}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/SA}
	\caption{Software Architecture Diagram}
	\label{fig:SA}
\end{figure}
The software structure diagram of the system is shown in the figure2. In the system, the upper computer layer and control layer need to carry out software programming.

In the upper computer layer, the system operator inputs the relevant operation information of the manipulator to the upper computer layer in the speech recognition interface or GUI interface. In the upper computer layer, the control information is calculated by kinematics, and the simple control effect is translated into the specific key motion (corresponding to the specific angle of each motor) of the manipulator in order to achieve the motion effect, The specific motion control information is transmitted to the control layer through the serial port and the designed communication protocol.Among them, the voice information is collected through the USB sound card, and can also be input into the voice file prepared locally.

After receiving the motion control information at the serial port, the control layer understands the case according to the designed communication protocol, and then controls the motor motion according to the information.

Through the timer and interrupt software, the PWM pulse signal required for motor motion is output at the GPIO pin. At the same time, the control layer can also feed back the control effect to the upper computer layer through the serial port for GUI display of the control effect.

\section{Implemented Requirements}

\subsection{Move}
It can move according to the input path within the allowable error range. The software part receives the user's input and performs simple operation in six directions, and the user can adjust the moving speed and single moving distance.

\subsection{Path Planning}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{MoveJ:}It is the operation of moving one unit, which is the differential unit of the following moveL function.
	\item \textbf{MoveL:}It is a linear moving function. By specifying the coordinates of the end point in the established coordinate system, the manipulator moves linearly from the current position to the target position.
	\item \textbf{MoveP:}It is a function that simulates the function of the palletizer. It simulates a system that grabs all items from one location and moves them to another location for automatic stacking. It can be stacked in multiple layers and is generally used for forklift transportation to warehouse storage.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
\subsection{GUI}
The system controls the movement of the whole manipulator through the interface. The main functions of the interface are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Input the coordinates and moving speed of the end effector, and click the end coordinate control button and start button to realize the function of moving the end effector to the input coordinates.
	\item Input the movement direction$(x, y, z)$, the coordinates of the movement distance and the movement speed, and click the single joint control button and start button to realize the function of the manipulator moving a certain distance in the input movement direction.
	\item Input the moving direction $(x, y, z)$, the coordinate of the moving distance and the moving speed, and click the simulate palletizing button and start button to realize the function of simulating palletizing through the curve movement of the manipulator.
	\item Click the up, down, left, right, front, back button and start button to realize the function of the manipulator moving a fixed distance in a certain direction.
	\item Realize the display function of input information of upper computer and feedback information of lower computer in the display text box.

	\caption{Direct Control GUI}
	\label{fig:GUI}
\end{figure}
\subsection{One Click Return}
In some cases, it may be necessary to return to the original position, so we designed a one button return function. By clicking reset on the GUI, we can return the manipulator to its original position.

\subsection{Writing}
In the system, the combined movement mode of numbers and letters is stored, and the robot arm can be controlled to move and write numbers and letters through speech recognition.Detailed examples can be viewed in the submitted video.

	\caption{Writing}
	\label{fig:W}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Palletizing}
After entering the target location, it will plan a curve that does not wipe the ground, then slow down to the highest position, and then move to the target location in the same way. Simulate the process of moving an object by an excavator.
\subsection{Speech Recognition}
The system uses Baidu voice API, which can recognize the user's real-time voice and audio files, and convert the voice into text, so as to control the movement of the manipulator.
This project supports the use of speech recognition function to operate the manipulator movement, the main operations include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Choose up, down, left, right, front and back six directions to move, you can adjust the moving distance.
	\item Simulate palletizing machine function and plan reasonable path. Complete the simulation of palletizing operation.
	\item According to the user's voice input, write numbers or letters to meet the user's needs.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/S}
	\caption{Speech Recognition GUI}
	\label{fig:S}
\end{figure}
We also provide a GUI for speech recognition system, but you need to connect raspberry pi to a monitor to see it. You can't use SSH to connect raspberry pi to see the GUI. A screenshot of the GUI is shown in Figure 7.
\section{Advantages and Disadvantages}
\subsection{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Using manipulator instead of manual operation can not only improve the efficiency, but also has a high fault tolerance rate.
	\item The mechanical arm can achieve large-scale mass production, reduce labor costs and technical training costs, optimize cost control, and the product price has market competitiveness.
	\item Professional and technical team can quickly tailor automation solutions according to different product and process requirements of users.
	\item The robot arm has universal design characteristics, which can not only meet the automatic production of "small variety and large batch" workpieces, but also meet the application requirements of "multi variety and small batch".
	\item The mechanical arm is composed of software and hardware, which is highly integrated, high fault tolerance, few fault points and low maintenance cost.
	\item The software system not only develops a simple and beautiful interface, but also provides the function of input speech recognition. The user interaction is very rich.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is no autonomous mobile capability, and user input is needed to trigger the mobile.
	\item At present, it only supports writing simple numbers and letters, and it is still difficult to write Chinese characters.
	\item The weight of the equipment is not fully considered when making the manipulator. The base of the manipulator is unstable and may fall down.
	\item The wiring of the device is more complicated, and some peripherals such as a monitor, sound card, microphone, mouse, keyboard, etc. are also required.
\end{itemize}

\section{Improvement}
According to the analysis of our advantages and disadvantages, there are many things we can do to improve this program:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The precision error of the X, Y, Z three-axis motion of the manipulator motor is about 0.5cm. After that, experiments and tests can be carried out continuously to optimize the software system, improve the precision, reduce the error and achieve more accurate movement.
	\item At present, the system only supports the writing of letters and numbers, but does not support the writing of complex Chinese characters in mobile programs. This system will continuously improve the software system, and input Chinese characters into the system thesaurus, so that the manipulator can support writing Chinese characters.
	\item At present, the system supports writing on the plane, and then the writing function can be extended to three-dimensional space to complete the writing and description of three-dimensional patterns.
	\item At present, the system supports fixed-point movement, that is, six directions of movement in three-dimensional space, and then can add rotation, expansion and other mobile functions according to the actual needs.
